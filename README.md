## Supervised Change Detection using Pre-Change Optical-SAR and Post-Change SAR Data

This work proposes a novel change detection data setting which uses both optical and SAR images pre-change, yet only SAR imagery post-change. For this challenging scenario, we propose a Siamese network that processes the pre-change and post-change SAR inputs using a shared set of weights, while the pre-change optical input is processed using a network that do not share the weights with the SAR inputs.
